# unstructured-data-analytics
Coursework for Analytics for Unstructured Data at UT Austin

Following is the range of concepts and topics covered in the assignments: \
\
luxury-cars-edmunds.ipynb - In the first HW of the course, I implemented conceptual text analytics, purely focusing on the insights that can be uncovered by word frequency and multiple word co-occurences in documents. Algorithms and concepts for word frequency, pairwise lift analysis,and  zipfs law implemented and tested throughout the assignment. The problem at hand required scrapping luxury cars review data from Edmunds.com and analyzing the brand closeness via text analytics. \
\
beer-recommender-system.ipynb - In the second HW of the course, I created the building blocks of a beer recommender system based on data scraped from beeradvocate.com. The key tasks involved analyzing rating and reviews to recommend top three beers based on top three features entered by the user. The recommnedations were built using spacy similarity and vader for sentiment analysis.
